This task helped me to get a glimpse of OCR - Optical Character Recognition. 
Using pytesseract I was able to complete the task. :  https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/
Pytesseract Usage section helped me to complete 90% of the task. Installed pytesseract and pillow using pip. The intial problem I encountered was 
that, the code couldnt find tesseract. So I changed the os-platform to windows and installed everything there and tried to run the code
which was successful. Tried to make image files and tried different addition, subtraction problems and also texts, which tesseract was successful 
in evaluating.
